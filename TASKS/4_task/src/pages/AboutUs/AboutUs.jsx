          In 1985, Roman Arnold and his brother Franc Arnold (who is no longer
          involved with the company) founded 'Radsport Arnold' GmbH as a
          supplier of bike parts for cycling. It was not until 1996 that the
          first bikes with the brand name Canyon appeared. Radsport Arnold
          adopted a direct sales strategy via the Internet. In 2001, the company
          took the step from being a supplier to becoming a cycle manufacturer
          and changed its name to Canyon Bicycles GmbH. With Lutz Scheffer
          (formerly Bergwerk and Votec) Canyon was able to secure the services
          of a frame designer. In the next few years the firm based in Koblenz,
          Germany was able to hire Hans Christian Smolik along with other
          bicycle construction experts. In 2006, Canyon unveiled its new
          corporate design, which also received several awards in 2007 (European
          Design Award for Corporate Design, red dot design awards for Corporate
          and web design, iF Product Design Award for Corporate Design). In
          2018, Canyon launched its first e-bike called the Spectral:ON.[3] In
          2020, the brand launched the first in its line of Canyon Factory
          Racing (CFR) bikes (the Strive mountain bike),[4] a limited run of
          high-end bikes designed for professional riders. The current CFR line
          up consists of the Lux, Aeroad, Exceed, Sender, Endurace and Ultimate.
